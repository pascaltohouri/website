                <h2>Learning Representations and Symbolic Information</h2>
                <p>A machine learning experiment comprises many different elements. For example, when training an LLM, one specifies the architecture (attention heads, number of encoders and decoders, hyper-parameters/learning rate, etc.). These different elements are what make the experiment unique; changing them would recover a different experiment. </p>
                <p>The symbolic information that each experiment contains is like an abstract symmetry preserved across different representations. For example, one might represent an experiment (where an LLM is trained via SGD) as a programming script, a semantic vector, or in natural language. Each representation has different linguistic rules, and thus different properties (e.g., completeness, description lengths, self-referencing, etc.), but the essence of an experiment is preserved when translating between representations. </p>
                <p>A task with well-defined preferences over all these symbolic experiments may have an optimum, but with constant experiment features, the researcher may never find it. For example, sticking to an LLM architecture may guarantee that another superior architecture is never discovered, irrespective of the gains from scaling and training. So, it is important not to commit to one type of experiment, and instead invest in experiment agnostic search.</p>

                <h2>General Information-Theoretic Semantics</h2>
                <h3>Non-Experiment Objects</h3>
                <p>Experiments are not the only type of information that occupies this symbolic space of forms. Any thing distinct from nothingness and from other pieces of information may inhabit the space. For example, a dog, a person, a house, a feeling, an image - all these different human comprehensible objects has a unique essence that presents differently depending on the language used. This seems obvious because a single object has a different name across natural languages (e.g., "dog" is equivalent to "perro", "hund", "skylos", "kutta", and "gou"). </p>

                <h3>Alternate Representations and Semantic Geometry</h3>
                <p>It is natural to think that new languages might exist that allow us to express these symbolic essences more succinctly, or traverse between them with greater ease. So far, the semantic space of real-valued vectors is the most tractable language for expressing objects. We know, for example, that adding the vector from (man -> woman) to the vector from (0 -> king) returns the vector from (0 -> queen). So, an abstract space's geometry or rules may encode its semantics.</p>

                <h3>Traversals</h3>
                <p>This proposition raises the issue of traversals. If two experiments e_1 and e_2, are static "snapshot", for example an LLMs parameters pre- and post-training, then moving from e_1 to e_2 is precisely what happens during training. More generally, traversing the semantic vector space traces a path, and an onlooker may assign different values to each path. For example, an experimentalist may deem a path quickly converging to the global loss minimum "good", and a path stopping in a high-loss local minimum "bad".</p>
                    
                <h3>Path Generality</h3>
                These paths are not confined to specific architectures. The path might start at an LLM's semantic vector, pass through a GAN or VAE, and settle at a diffusion model. Moreover, these paths are not restricted to learning systems at all; a path may derail into a non-experiment object, especially when interpolating between well-defined objects in a smooth space.</p>
                
                <p>If the symbolic space really can represent all semantically distinct objects, </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is an example of a list item.</li>
                    <li>You can use lists to break down complex ideas.</li>
                    <li>Or to present key takeaways in a scannable format.</li>
